Done as a part of coding challende for Shipt.

# Description of the problem and solution.

A web app which allows searching for GitHub users, using the RESTful APIs and displays the user's image, GitHub handle, number and the avatars of the followers. Allows pagination with a "load more" capability to prevent flooding with data.

Binds input from the user to the API call - if the user exists, the required details are presented. On an unsuccessful match, text color is changed to red and the details correcpoinding to the last successful search is shown.

# Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

Makes us of jQuery to interact with the RESTful API provided by GitHub. A great way to increase the efficiency and decrease the time-lag is to use the Progressive Web App or a similar framework allowing caching the successful (and loggin unsuccessful) searches. This can in-fact be done by investing some more time into the app.
